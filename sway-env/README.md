# sway

Sway configuration files.

Can be used either as a standalone repo, or as a git submodule for
the `grscheller/dotfiles` GitHub repo.

## Installation Location

To install these files to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/` from a standalone
alone `grscheller/sway-env` repo:

```
   $ ./swayInstall [-s {install|check|repo}]
```

If `grscheller/sway-env` is a submodule of `grscheller/dotfiles`, do not
run it directly from the submodule.  It is designed to be called from
a subshell of `dfInstall`.
