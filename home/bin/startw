# sessions on different virtual consoles.  Systemd --user
# runs on a per user, not a per session, basis.  Systemd is
# being used to run Kanshi output daemon and Mako notification
# daemon.  As such, we need to ensure that only one instance
# of SWAY is running per user.  Since I am the only user on my
# computers, this scripts punts if is not launched from tty1.
