# Configuration for Alacritty, the GPU enhanced terminal emulator.
#
# Imports are loaded in order, skipping all missing files, with the importing
# file being loaded last. If a field is already present in a previous import, it
# will be replaced.
#
# All imports must either be absolute paths starting with `/`, or paths relative
# to the user's home directory starting with `~/`.
#
# Note: alacritty_arch.yml needs to be installed BEFORE alacritty.yml
#
# Note: If support for multiple OS is again needed, conditionally installing
#       different versions of this file depending on OS would be a good hook.
