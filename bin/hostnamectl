#!/bin/sh
# Wrapper for hostname - script will ignore its arguments.
# For use on non-systemd Linux systems or BSD based UNIX systems.
#
# Reason: On Arch based systems, I don't want to install the whole
#         inetutils package just to get the hostname command.
#
# Usage: hostnamectl whatever 
#
/bin/hostname
