# Wrapper for hostname
#
#   For use on non-systemd systems.  Script will ignore
#   its arguments.
#
# Purpose: On systemd systems I do not wish to install
#          the whole inetutils package (Arch) just to get hostname.
#          Therefore, on systems which do not have the hostnamectl
#          command, I need this wrapper.
#
# Usage: hostnamectl whatever 
#
/bin/hostname
