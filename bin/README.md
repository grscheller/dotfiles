## BIN Scripts

This directory contains various utility scripts used both in
my development environment and to maintain it.

They are installed into either `~/bin` or `~/.local/bin` depending
on the precedence I wish the scripts to take.  I wish `~/.local/bin`
to override most system executables while `~/bin` scripts take
least precedence.
