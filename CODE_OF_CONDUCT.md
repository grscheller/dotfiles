# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## The Project

The project consists of the grscheller/dotfiles GitHub repository
and its associated GitHub community infrastructure.  It is a
personnal project of its maintainer, Geoffrey R. Scheller.
Suggestions, constructive criticisms, and contributions are
all still very much welcomed.

## Purpose of Project

The primary purpose of this GitHub repo is to:

* preserve the maintainer's Arch Linux configuration files
* providing the infrastructure to install & upgrade these configs
* provide configuration examples to the linux community
  * without any sort of attribution expected
* provide a starting point for others to fork their own versions

## Community Standards

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and the maintainer pledge to making participation in the
project and associated community a harassment-free experience for
everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, formal education,
nationality, personal appearance, political persuation, race,
religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Examples of behavior contributing to
creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of derogatory, crude or sexualized language or imagery
* Insulting/derogatory comments
* Public or private harassment
* Personal or political attacks
* Publishing, without explicit permission, other peoples' private
  * physical addresses
  * email addresses
  * phone numbers
  * any other electronic addresses or handles
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Project Maintainer responsibilities

The project maintainer is responsible for clarifying the standards of
acceptable behavior and is expected to take appropriate and fair
corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable
behavior.

The project maintainer has the right and responsibility to remove,
edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and
other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct,
or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other
behaviors that a reasonable person would deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope of Community

This Code of Conduct applies to the project maintainer and whomever
uses the GitHub infrastructure available to GitHub users in regards
to GitHub workflows.  Geoffrey R. Scheller is the only individual
who represents this project.  Examples of representing a project
or community include using an official project e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an
appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior
may be reported by contacting the maintainer at geoffrey@scheller.com.
The maintainer will review and investigate all complaints, and will
respond in a way that he deems appropriate to the circumstances.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct was derived from the default boilerplate
provided by GitHub, which itself is based on the
[Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/)
code of conduct, most likely version 2.0.
